ContentCompilerBundle
=====================

Converts everything to HTML, including conversion from Markdown to HTML.

In short words it's an interface for conversion to HTML with
some example implementations made.

```php
/*
 * Wolnościowiec / ContentCompilerBundle
 * -------------------------------------
 *
 *   Converts everything to HTML, including conversion from Markdown to HTML.
 *   A part of an anarchist portal - wolnosciowiec.net
 *
 *   Wolnościowiec is a project to integrate the movement
 *   of people who strive to build a society based on
 *   solidarity, freedom, equality with a respect for
 *   individual and cooperation of each other.
 *
 *   We support human rights, animal rights, feminism,
 *   anti-capitalism (taking over the production by workers),
 *   anti-racism, and internationalism. We negate
 *   the political fight and politicians at all.
